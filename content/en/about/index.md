The Museum of Prophecies is located in Skagaströnd, a small town in the north of Iceland. It is dedicated to Þórdís, a local woman from the 10th century known for her prophetic visions. The museum is housed in an old, charming building that was once a community center and a school.

Þórdís was a völva, a seeress, who lived in Skagaströnd during the settlement period. She was known for her prophecies and is one of the few named prophetesses in the sagas. Her most famous prophecy was about the future settlement of the area. She predicted that a woman with a gold ring in her nose would settle in the area, and this prophecy came true.

The museum offers an interactive exhibition where visitors can learn about Þórdís and her prophecies. It also provides insight into the historical and cultural context of her time. The exhibition includes multimedia presentations and installations, including a "prophecy tunnel" where visitors can experience the feeling of traveling through time.

The Museum of Prophecies is not just a place to learn about the past. It is also a place to reflect on the present and the future. Visitors are invited to make their own prophecies, which are collected and displayed in the museum. This unique feature adds a personal touch to the museum experience and allows visitors to become a part of the ongoing story of prophecy in Skagaströnd.
